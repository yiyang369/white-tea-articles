## Storage Conditions and Timeframes

Fuding white tea is a type of white tea that undergoes minimal oxidation during the production process. This process makes it prone to spoilage if not stored properly. Here are some guidelines to ensure optimal storage and preservation:

- **First stage (0-2 years)**: During this period, the tea will undergo a natural oxidation process, which enhances its flavor and aroma. This is the perfect time to store Fuding white tea, as it is still young and vibrant.
- **Second stage (2-5 years)**: As the tea ages, it will undergo a transition period, where the flavor and aroma mature and stabilize. This is an excellent time to store Fuding white tea, as it develops a more complex character.
- **Third stage (5-10 years)**: During this period, the tea will reach its prime, with a balanced flavor and aroma. This is the perfect time to drink Fuding white tea, as it offers a smooth and satisfying experience.
- **Fourth stage (10+ years)**: After 10 years, the tea will enter a stable and slow transformation period, where it becomes even more complex and refined. However, this is also a challenging time to store Fuding white tea, as it requires precise control of temperature, humidity, and light exposure.

## Best Practices for Storage

To preserve the quality of Fuding white tea, follow these best practices:

- **Store in a cool, dry place**: Avoid storing your Fuding white tea in humid or hot environments, as this can cause the tea to absorb odors and lose its flavor.
- **Use airtight containers**: Store your Fuding white tea in airtight containers, such as glass jars or wooden chests, to prevent moisture and air from entering.
- **Keep away from light**: Direct sunlight can cause Fuding white tea to lose its delicate flavor and aroma. Store your tea in a shaded area or use UV-blocking containers.
- **Maintain a consistent temperature**: Store your Fuding white tea in an area with a consistent temperature between 10-20°C (50-68°F).
- **Monitor humidity levels**: Keep the humidity level between 50-60% to prevent the tea from absorbing moisture and losing its flavor.
